### Atlanta Crime Analysis 
This project is an analysis of the crime in Atlanta from 2009-2022. The data was downloaded as multiple csv files.  I created a python script, which is referenced in this project, to parse column names in each file to restructure a single data frame.

Tools used:
- Python  
-- Pandas  
-- Altair
